\title{Sample expression mean and variance for each gene}
\usage{
splatPopAssignMeans(params, key)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{SplatPopParams object containing parameters for population
scale simulations. See \code{\link{SplatPopParams}} for details.}

\item{key}{Partial splatPop key data.frame.}
}
\value{
The key updated with assigned means and variances.
}
\description{
A mean and coefficient of variation is assigned to each gene by sampling from
gamma distributions parameterized from real data in `splatPopEstimate`.
The cv gamma distributions are binned by gene mean because the distribution
of variance in real data is not independent from the mean. The degree of
similarity between individuals can be further tuned using the
similarity.scale parameter in `SplatPopParams`.
